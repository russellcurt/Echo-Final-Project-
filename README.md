UC Berkeley Ext. UX/UI Design

General Notes:

Look into when to use 1. href vs src 2. button vs input 3. flex vs grid

HTML:

CSS - when to use "." selector vs "#" selector

Both are used to select content to set the style.

1. "."
   a. used to represent class names
   b. each element can contain multiple "." selectors
   c. not unique, can apply to multiple elements if HTML elements hold same class property

2. "#"
   a. used to represent id
   b. Each element can contain only one "#" selector
   c. is unique
