GENERAL NOTES

Look more into when to use

1. href vs src
2. button vs input
3. flex vs grid

HTML:

Shortcut: type html:5 into html for boilerplate

<span> inline level

<div> block level

CSS:

    CSS - when to use "." selector vs "#" selector
    Both are used to select content to set the style.
    1. "."
        a. used to represent class names
        b. each element can contain multiple "." selectors
        c. not unique, can apply to multiple elements if HTML elements hold same class property
    2. "#"
        a. used to represent id
        b. Each element can contain only one "#" selector
        c. is unique

Combinators:
(>) combinator encompasses parent and child element (think relative pathing). _note it is very specific_ This selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.

(space) combinator is not as specific. This is a descendant selector which matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.

_highly suggest looking up css specificity order_
